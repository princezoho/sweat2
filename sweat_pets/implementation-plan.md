# Sweat Pets Implementation Plan

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for the Sweat Pets game, with testable acceptance criteria for each feature.

### Phase 1: Core Game Foundation
1. **Basic Game Setup** ‚úì
   - ‚úì Create Flutter project with Flame engine
   - ‚úì Set up basic dependencies (Flame, shared_preferences, health, notifications)
   - ‚úì Test: Project builds and runs without errors

2. **Data Model Implementation** ‚úì
   ```dart
   class PetState {
     int totalSteps;
     int currentLevel;
     DateTime lastActive;
     List<String> achievements;
   }
   ```
   - ‚úì Test: Can create, serialize, and deserialize pet state

3. **Step Counter System** ‚úì
   - ‚úì Implement manual step input UI
   - ‚úì Store daily and average steps
   - ‚úì Test: Steps persist between app restarts
   - ‚úì Test: Daily steps reset every 24 hours

4. **Evolution System** üöß
   - Implement both Daily and Average evolution levels
   - Create level calculation based on step thresholds
   - Test: Pet correctly evolves/devolves based on steps
   - Test: Level calculations match specification thresholds

### Phase 2: Pet Visualization
5. **Basic Pet Rendering**
   - Set up Flame game widget
   - Create basic pet sprite rendering
   - Test: Pet appears on screen
   - Test: Basic animations work

6. **Pet Animation States**
   - Implement idle animation
   - Add level-specific animations
   - Test: Animations change with evolution level
   - Test: Smooth transitions between states

7. **Pet Evolution Visualization**
   - Create evolution transition effects
   - Add visual indicators for level changes
   - Test: Evolution effects trigger at correct thresholds
   - Test: Visual feedback matches state changes

### Phase 3: Game Systems
8. **Achievement System**
   - Implement achievement tracking
   - Create achievement unlock notifications
   - Test: Achievements unlock at correct milestones
   - Test: Achievements persist between sessions

9. **Inactivity System**
   - Implement lastActive timestamp tracking
   - Add inactivity decay logic
   - Test: Pet shows fatigue after 24h inactivity
   - Test: Average steps decay works correctly

10. **Health/Happiness Meter**
    - Add visual meter UI
    - Implement meter logic based on activity
    - Test: Meter responds to step input
    - Test: Meter affects pet appearance

### Phase 4: Data Integration
11. **Local Data Persistence**
    - Implement SharedPreferences storage
    - Add auto-save functionality
    - Test: All game state persists correctly
    - Test: Data loads correctly on app start

12. **Health Platform Integration**
    - Set up HealthKit/Google Fit permissions
    - Implement step data retrieval
    - Test: Can read real step data
    - Test: Step data updates correctly

### Phase 5: Polish & UX
13. **Notifications**
    - Implement local notifications
    - Add inactivity reminders
    - Test: Notifications trigger correctly
    - Test: Notification interactions work

14. **UI Polish**
    - Add proper UI/UX elements
    - Implement responsive design
    - Test: UI works on different screen sizes
    - Test: All interactions feel smooth

15. **Performance Optimization**
    - Implement proper asset loading
    - Add loading states
    - Test: App performs well on low-end devices
    - Test: No frame drops during animations

## Implementation Guidelines

Each feature implementation should include:
- Unit tests where applicable
- Integration tests for feature interactions
- UI tests for visual elements
- Documentation of the implementation

## Progress Tracking

- ‚úì = Completed
- üöß = In Progress
- ‚è≥ = Pending
- ‚ùå = Blocked

## Dependencies

- Flutter SDK
- Flame game engine
- shared_preferences for local storage
- health package for HealthKit/Google Fit integration
- flutter_local_notifications for notifications

## Notes

- Features should be implemented in order as later features depend on earlier ones
- Each feature should be tested independently before integration
- Regular performance testing should be conducted throughout development
- Documentation should be updated as features are implemented
